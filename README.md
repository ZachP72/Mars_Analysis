# Mars_Analysis
In this analysis I created a web page that took information from other various sites and scraped that data onto mine. This allowed me to view information all in one place, rather than looking around for it on numerous others. 

## Step 1
1. Write Code is written that retrieves the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
2. Have full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary.
3. Titles for the hemisphere images are added to the dictionary.
4. Create a list containing the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image.

## Step 2
1. Create a scraping.py file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
2. Make a Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
3. Create the index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image. 4.After the scraping has been completed,    the web app contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.
